The researchers on the @p[Rog-O-Matic] project are pleased to report that the
Amulet of Yendor was obtained three times this semester, on the
following dates, with the following scores:
@begin(itemize)
Sep 28, 1982 guy 14655 gold, total winner, on level 26

Oct  9, 1982 mlm 43042 gold, total winner, on level 56

Nov  3, 1982 mlm 90132 gold, total winner, on level 26
@end(itemize)

@p[Rog-O-Matic] is a computer fantasy game with a newer twist.  It is crt
oriented and the object of the game is to automatically survive the
attacks of various monsters and get a lot of gold, rather than having
to actually type the required commands yourself.

@p[Rog-O-Matic XI] is the all new improved automatic Rogue player, now a
member of the Fighter's Guild in good standing.  @p[Rog-O-Matic XI]
incorporates the latest state-of-the-art mining technology to achieve an
unprecedented advance in automatic dungeoning. @p[Rog-O-Matic] now cheats
better than ever before, with the inclusion of modern magic arrow
technology and knowledge of the double haste bug.

Once you have entered the world of @p[Rog-O-Matic] you will stay there,
passively watching the game unfold before you much like a catatonic
teenager watching television.  Profiling and algorithm analysis have
enabled us to produce a program capable of playing Rogue far faster
than a human player.  We have now achieved production quality tool for
the elimination of mindless effort on the part of Unix@foot(Unix is a
registered trademark of Bell Labs) users everywhere.

@p[Rog-O-Matic] has attracted a large and varied user community. 
On the GPVax alone there are 39 regular users. On this continent, it is
known on both the East and West coasts, as far South as Houston, and
as far North as Boston. It is now being installed in the Southern
Hemisphere by our technical liason to Australia (Leonard G. C. Hamey).
Few Computer Scientists have been able to resist the temptation to
@i<tune> @p[Rog-O-Matic], even Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs has his own
private version of the code.
