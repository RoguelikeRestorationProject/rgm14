* Here is Rog-O-Matic XIV, the automatic Rogue player for the eighties! *

1.0 UNPACKING:

Rog-O-Matic is shipped by mail as a collection of shell archives.  Run
the distribution files through the shell (e.g. "sh rgm14.01"), and the
individual source files will be created.  Rog-O-Matic is also stored on
the General Purpose Vax at Carnegie-Mellon University, and may be
retrieved via FTP using the following file name:

		mlm/rgm/rgm14.tar.Z @ G.CS.CMU.EDU	

This file is a compressed tar format file.  For FTP access, the
username is 'ftpguest' and the password is 'cmunix'.

2.0 INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

Tear along the dotted line and put all files into a directory. You should
have the following files:

	Bugreport     findscore.c   main.c        rogomatic.6   survival.c
	README        gene.c        makefile      rooms.c       tactics.c
	arms.c        globals.h     mess.c        rplot         termtokens.h
	command.c     histplot.c    monsters.c    scorefile.c   things.c
	database.c    install.h     pack.c        search.c      titlepage.c
	datesub.l     io.c          rand.c        setup.c       types.h
	debug.c       learn.c       replay.c      stats.c       utility.c
	explore.c     ltm.c         rgmplot.c     strategy.c    worth.c

Bugreport contains descriptions of any known bugs and patches to fix them.
Main.c is the main file of Rog-O-Matic, and contains descriptions of all
other files.  Install.h contains the installation dependent preprocessor
variables. 

Edit "install.h" to set up various log files and directories, and then
create the RGMDIR directory, making certain that it is publicly readable
and writable.  After that, the 'make' command will build your own
personalized automatic Rogue playing system!

The preprocessor variables defined are:

BEST:           The compile time copy of the best current score. 
		Now 43,402 (against 3.6) and 7935 (against 5.2),
		and 11,316, total winner (against Rogue 5.3).
BOGUS:          The highest score to be considered "reasonable" by
                Rog-O-Matic. Rog-O-Matic will only try to beat non-bogus
                scores. Currently set at 50,000.
ERRORLOG:	A fully qualified filename to which snapshots of game
		positions are appended when severe or fatal bugs/
                inconsistencies are found.
LOCKFILE:	A file name in in the /tmp directory used to serialize
		accesses to the score file.
MAXLOCK:	A number of seconds after which to ignore the lock file.
		Usually 3 minutes (120 seconds).
NEWROGUE:	On systems where the default Rogue is 3.6, this is the
		name of the Rogue 5.2 or Rogue 5.3 file.
PLAYER:         This is the file name of the player program, which is
                execl'ed by the rogomatic program. It should be fully
                qualified.
RGMDIR:		The name of the directory where the Rog-O-Matic gene pool,
		long term memory, and score files are kept.  It must be 
		publicly readable and writeable.  This directory must
		be created by hand.
ROGUE:          This is the file name of the Rogue game. Usually this is
                /usr/games/rogue.
ROGUELOG:       When the game logging (or "echoing") is enabled, a
		complete transcript of the game is written to this
		file.  If the program finishes normally, this file
		will be renamed to <killer>.<level>.<score>, and can 
		either be examined by "cat"ing it or replayed using the
		"-p" option of rogomatic. This should be an unqualified
		file name.
SNAPSHOT:	An unqualified file name where game snapshots are put.
		The 'snapshot' command appends game photos to this file
		in the user's directory.

After "make"ing, you should have the following programs:

        rogomatic  player  datesub  rgmplot  histplot gene

and the shell script:

        rplot


These should be put into the games directory, in such a way that the player
program has the same name as that specified by the PLAYER variable in
install. Otherwise, you will have to "cd" to the directory containing
Rogomatic to play.

3.0 DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PROGRAMS AND COMMANDS.

3.1 ROGOMATIC

    The files "rogomatic" and "player" contain the basic Rog-O-Matic.
    Rogomatic parses the arguments and forks and execs Rogue and Player.
    For more information about the "rogomatic" command, see rogomatic.6.

    Usage:	rogomatic [-ceuw]			Play a game
	of	rogomatic -f game_file			Play against game_file
	or	rogomatic -r [ rogue_save_file ]	Start saved game
	or	rogomatic -p [ game_log ]		Replay game log
    	or	rogomatic -s [ version ]		Show scores

	-c	Cheat (look for magic arrows, version 3.6 only)
	-e	Echo, log the game into a file
	-u	Start up in user (transparent mode)
	-w	Watched (Rog-O-Matic can ask user for help when stuck -- rare)
	-f	next argument is the location of the Rogue game, eg:
			rogomatic -f /usr/games/rogue
	-r	Start a saved game, if next argument is given, it is the
		location of the Rogue save file.
	-p	Replay a Rog-O-Matic log file (created using the -e
		option).  If next argument is given it is the name of
		the log file. The default is "roguelog". Eg:
			rogomatic -p drag.24.7361
	-s	List Rog-O_Matic's scorefile.  Version must be one
		of (3.6, 5.2, 5.3).  Defaults to install.h:DEFVER.

3.2 RPLOT

    "rplot" prints a scatter plot of the rogomatic score file. Options
    allow for inclusion of scores obtained by cheating and addition of
    a rolling average to the plot.  "rplot" uses the rgmplot program.

    Usage:	rogomatic -s [ version ] | rplot [ -ac ] [ minimum ]

    Options:	-a	Include rolling average
		-c	Include scores obtained by cheating ( 3.6 only )
		[ min ]	Include only scores above min.
	
3.3 HISTPLOT

    "histplot" reads the scorefile and produces a histogram of either
    final score or level reached, depending on the option set.  The
    histogram plots the killing monster for each game.

    Usage:	rogomatic -s [ version ] | histplot [ -acl ]

    Options:	-aNNNN	Include only scores above NNNN
		-c	Include cheating games ( 3.6 only )
		-l	Plot level instead of score

3.4 GENE

    "gene" summarizes and initializes the current gene pool.
    
    Usage:	gene [ -f ] [ -v<value> ]	Read gene pool
	or	gene -i [ -msv<value> ]		Create new gene pool

    Options:	-i	Initial a new gene pool
		-f	Full listing, shows gene values and scores
		-mNN	Max gene pool size (limit of 100, learn.c:MAXM)
		-s	Random number seed for new gene pool (-i option)
		-v	Version to list/initial (one of 361,362,521,522,531)

4.0 MORE ABOUT FILES

4.1 SCOREFILES

For each version of Rogue the systems has played, their are 2 score
files: $RGMDIR/rgmdelta<version> and $RGMDIR/rgmscore<version>.  As
each game is played, the score is appended to the DELTA file.  Whenever
the -s option is given, a check is made for the DELTA file.  If new
scores exist, they are sorted and a new SCORE file is created. Then
the score file is printed on stdout.

4.2 READING THE SOURCE

   For those perusing the source, the following files are in the
source.  The notes indicate how important an understanding of that file
is to understanding the strategy Rogomatic uses, and whether that file
contains system code, strategy code, or utility code.

    ROG-O-MATIC: A Belligerent Expert System    (CMU-CS-83-144)   ABSTRACT

   "Rog-O-Matic  is  an  unusual combination of algorithmic and production
    systems programming techniques which cooperate to  explore  a  hostile
    environment. This environment is the computer game Rogue, which offers
    several  advantages  for  studying  exploration  tasks.    This  paper
    presents the major features of the Rog-O-Matic system,  the  types  of
    knowledge  sources  and  rules  used  to  control the exploration, and
    compares the performance of the system with human Rogue players."

    An  abbreviated  but more recent version of this paper appeared in the
    conference proceedings of CSCSI in May of 1984.
    
    A short reference to  Rog-O-Matic  also appeared in the  February 1985
    Computer Recreations column of Scientific American, page 18-21.
