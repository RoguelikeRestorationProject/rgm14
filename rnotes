	c - teleport to       5,  60
	d - cancellation      5, 130

	Note: A wand of 'teleport to' is useful in that it will unstick you
	from a violet fungus!

Suggested algorithm for wand usage:

	If you have never fired a wand, stand 3 or 4 paces from a wall and
	fire the wand at it, making certain that no monsters are around (thus
	the room should be lit). Depending on the message you get, you have
	one of the following wands (46% of the time):

	"the room is lit"		light
	"missile vanishes"		magic missile
	"bolt bounces"          	lightening
	"flame bounces"			fire
	"ice bounces"			cold
	"you have a tingling feeling"	drain life

	If none of these messages appear, then there are five wands you would
	like to get and three you wouldn't.

Alternate algorithm:

	Find some congenial monster in a lit room. Stand three paces
	from him and fire the wand. Easiest is to find some sleeping
	monster besides a bat and stand four paces away, then hit him
	with an arrow to wake him up. Note that he must be awake.  Use
	the following results:

	"the room is lit"			light
	"you hit" with one of -\|/		lightening/fire/cold
	different monster now two away		polymorph
	"you hit" with *			magic missile
	monster now adjacent			haste monster/teleport to
	you take hits				drain life
	monster disappears (not killed)		teleport away

	monster now two paces away, sit for one turn

	still two paces away		slow monster
	now adjacent			nothing/cancellation/striking

	This tells you almost everything you need to know, but you must
	get the monster into the right place. Striking only works on
	adjacent monsters, so this won't disambiguate it very well.
	Also, you should probably assume the bolt weapon is fire, since
	that way you won't be surprised by a dragon later.
