Wish List:

- Check "path to room" for searching walls, not just "room known".
- Notice door on opposite wall when searching for "path to room".
* Find out why it doesn't always hit fungi first!
- Add lost monster code.
- Add paradigmatic monster/situation analysis.
- Do "Incremental Searching" for secret doors.
- Have it infer create monster if a monster shows up.
- Have it infer hold monster if it knows create monster.
- Make r-m smarter about which walls are worth looking at.
- Put common code to dwait and play into a single function.
- Put on cursed stuff before reading unknown scrolls if you don't know what...
- Speed up expval (5-7% of all time in expval).
- Speed up searchto (28-35% of all time in searchto).

* Fix secret door searching (move three squares)
* Test move (rather than makemove)
* Unpin first, then fight
* Fix trap acquisition code

Modified for Rogue 5.2:

* Added Rogomatic version to rogomatic scoreboard
* Added ring of "maintain armor"
* Added userid to Rogue Name (Rog-O-Matic <version> for <uid>).
* Ammended cheat heuristics to consider version. No known bugs in 5.2 yet.
* Automatic version detection (complete compatiblity).
* Don't add revvideo monsters to monster list.
* Don't attack Floating Eyes anymore (they can be deadly).
* Don't wield striking. It now uses up a charge when you hit.
* Fixed terpbot to handle maxstrength.
* Fixed trailing dots in mess.c.
* Modified armor strategy to take "maintain armor" ring into account.
* Modified genocide order. Now "UDVPXWITMFYCQRAHJGLNOSZBE".
* Lower case all messages in mess.c, to simplify it.
* Try to light up treasure rooms.

Rogue 5.2 bugs:

  The ring bug still seems to appear in R5.2. Last night Rogo was wearing
  a ring of sustain strength, which was stolen by a nymph. When he tried
  next to use a ring, he was out of synch with Rogue (and maybe Rogue was
  out of touch with the world anyway). Interrupting didn't help.

  Wand of striking bug, doesn't buy anything.


Rogue 5.2a:

* Poison and extra healing cure cosmic.
- What does a wand of invisiblity do?


Things to fix for Rogue53:

- Better knowledge of Level geometry, when to search for doors
- Learning of special attacks
- General learning of strategies (hah!)
- Explore levels in a goal directed manner -- affects findrooms()
